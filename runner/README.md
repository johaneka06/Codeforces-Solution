# Codeforces/Runner

Runner is used for running the test cases automatically.

## How to used it:

1. Place the input files (create .in files) in input folder (input file will be used for inputting the value to your solution)

2. Place the expected output files (create .out files) in jury folder (expected output files will be compared with your solution answer)

3. Place your code (.cpp files) in this folder (Your cpp files **CAN'T CONTAIN ANY SPACES**)

4. Open command prompt, and navigate to this folder

5. Just type ``run`` and everything will be done automatically

## What the run.bat does:

1. Checks whether there's an output file (.out) that generated by the previous compilation or not

2. Check is there any .cpp file or not

3. If there's a .cpp file, then run.bat will compile it and generate ```a.exe``` file

4. After the compilation process complete, run.bat will automatically inputs, creates a file (contain the output of your solution), and compares it with the value inside in the jury folder.
